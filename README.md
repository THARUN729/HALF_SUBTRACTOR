# HALF_SUBTRACTOR
# AIM:
To simulate and synthesis half subtractor using vivado.

# APPARATUS REQUIRED:
vivado 2023.2 software.

# PROCEDURE:
```
STEP:1 Start the vivado software, Select and Name the New project.
STEP:2 Select the device family, device, package and speed.
STEP:3 Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the Source type.
STEP:4 Type the File Name and module name and Click Next and then finish button. Type the code and save it.
STEP:5 Select the run simulation and then run Behavioral Simulation in the Source Window and click the check syntax.
STEP:6 Click the simulation to simulate the program and give the inputs and verify the outputs as per the truth table.
STEP:7 compare the output with truth table.
```

# VERILOG CODE:
# HALF_SUBTRACTOR:
# Program
```
module half_subtractor (a,b,diff, borr);
input a,b;
output diff, borr;
wire x;
xor (diff,a,b);
not (x,a);
and (borr,x,b);
endmodule
```
# Output
![halfsubtractor](https://github.com/THARUN729/HALF_SUBTRACTOR/assets/161407766/d9b2ac89-cefb-4f8a-ab60-cdf87db247a7)

# RESULT:
Thus the verilog program for half subtractor has been simulated and verified successfully.
